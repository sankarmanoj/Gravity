Gravity
=======
EandG : 
Each factor decides the strength of a force
fg is the factor for Gravity
fe is the factor for Electrostatic force
num is the number of particles
damp is a factor that damps particles, which are closer than a critical radius. It reduces the relative velocity of those particles, along the line joining the particles
debug is a boolean that creates only two particles orbiting around each other

Gravity :
Code that impliments gravitational interaction between non-charged particles.
factor corrosponds to the 'strenght' of the gravitational pull.
num refers to the number of interacting particles.
